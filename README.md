# 🧠 Churn Prediction Web Application

This project was developed as the final project for the **CS50 - Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science** course. It combines full-stack web development with data science and machine learning to create a complete, practical system for **customer churn prediction** in an e-commerce scenario.

## 🚀 Overview

Using a Kaggle dataset of e-commerce customers, I built a predictive model to estimate churn probability, then created a web application where:

- Users can **upload Excel spreadsheets** or **manually register customers**.
- The system will **predict the churn probability** for each customer.
- All customers and predictions are stored and displayed.
- There's a **dashboard page** with charts and global churn analysis.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**: Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Future Engine**: For pipeline and feature engineering automation
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Visualization**: Chart.js

## 📊 Key Features

- Upload or register clients individually
- Automated churn prediction using trained ML model
- Real-time probability display
- Dashboard for data overview and visual analytics
- Clean and responsive UI

## 📁 Dataset

The data was sourced from a public e-commerce churn dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction).


## 💡 Inspiration

This project was inspired by the intersection of what I learned in:
- CS50 by Harvard (algorithms, Python, web development)
- Teo Me Why’s Machine Learning course
